    <h1>About The Trainer</h1>
    <p>
      Crystal Baker has made a lifelong pursuit perfecting her skills as a
      horseman and trainer. For generations her family has been involved in the
      horse industry. From working cowboys and a family farm, to champion
      driving and saddle seat competitors, it is no exaggeration to say that
      horsemanship is in Crystal's blood. However, her horseman roots were only
      the beginning.

      At a very early age, Crystal's Mom and Dad (Margie and Russell) saw that
      Crystal had an unusual gift working with horses. Instead of investing in
      college tuition, they spent all of their money, time and resources
      investing in the best riding programs for Crystal to be a part of. From
      the age of 6, Crystal was continuously immersed in the horse show world.
      As a result, she grew up riding and working for some of the best names in
      the business. Some of the names and places that Crystal rode and worked
      for are:

      Lynne Dye-Husted (Boulder Knoll Stables), Jack Stecker (AQHA World
      Champion), Lisa Wysocki (ApHA World Champion), Dave McKay (AHA National
      Champion), Judy Hook (AHA National Champion), Kathy Johnson, Eddy Wiggens
      and Shannon Armstrong (Feature Farms - AHA National Champion). However,
      the quest for knowledge never stops. Crystal still works with top level,
      nationally recognized trainers whenever possible. Recently, Crystal spent
      time in Iowa with AHA Horseman of the year Jodi Strand (Strand's
      Arabians).

      Crystal began riding professionally in 1988 and opened her own business
      (Cedar Hill Training Center) officially in 1994. For many years, she
      partnered with Lynne Dye-Husted at Boulder Knoll stables in Spanaway
      Washington, where Cedar Hill grew and thrived. Crystal's training program
      has produced numerous titles in multiple breeds including: Regional,
      National and World Champions.
